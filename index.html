								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/chris-lawton-5IHz5WhosQE-unsplash.jpg" alt="" /></a>

							<p>I am a software engineer with a background in databases and machine learning. In these domains I am most
							experienced with Microsoft SQL Server and Tensorflow, but have had some experience with other platforms
							such as Firebase and MySQL, as well as creating my own machine learning models from scratch in Python.
							While I focus mainly in python, I have worked in several other languages such as C, Bash, Java, SQL, and
							HTML to name a few.<br><br>I majored in psychology in college but learned that research was not for me. Given the limited experience
							of college I decided to work in the field to learn what direction I wanted to progress in future. After a
							short job working with troubled kids at an after school program I learned I enjoyed helping people solve their
							problems and chose to complete a case management program. During the program I was placed in an internship at
							a company that worked with 16 to 25 year old homeless males who had substance abuse and other mental health
							issues. I made an impression both with the clients and the program director by showing my competency in helping
							the clients get out of their comfort zone to try new things and immediately identifying and coming up with several
							proposed solutions to issues with the HIPAA records the site had to maintain. I was hired before the end of my
							internship and after a year the program director appealed to the corporate office to create a leadership position
							for me at the site in order to retain my services. I took over training of new staff as well as a portion of the
							duties of the program director in addition to those of my previous role. During my further attempts to improve the
							operation of the program, I encountered databases for the first time and chose to take night courses in Database
							Administration. After some family issues and a growing realization that working in mental health was taking a toll
							on me emotionally, I spent some time searching for a job in database management. I quickly realized that I lacked
							a greater understanding of the field and should pursue a greater education in software engineering. The Holberton
							program perfectly suited my goals and needs and after some delays due to the outbreak of covid, I began my journey
							as a software engineer.<br><br>I take a lot of pride in my work and always feel I should be striving to do it both
							competently and efficiently. I know my experience working in mental health has given me the skills to work calmly
							during a crisis, find common ground with anyone I meet, step back to view problems from perspectives other than my own,
							mediate conflicts, and generally communicate in an open, clear, and respectful manner. I know that a team needs clear
							communication, delegation, and goals to function effectively, and that supporting teammates to do their jobs makes
							everyones easier in the long run. My time at the Holberton School has taught me many skills for personal and group 
							problem solving and how to effectively and efficiently request help from peers without wasting both our time. The projects
							I have worked on for the last 2 years have given me insights and understanding into the field of technology that were sorely
							lacking before. I feel both more well rounded and capable of improvement in any area.</p>
